# Shock-Tube-Simulation
This study examines the interaction between a contact wave and a reflected shock in a shock tube with a 6 m driver section of high-pressure N2 and a 10 m driven section of air at 300 K. A 1D CFD simulation using mass, momentum, and energy equations identifies the interaction time by analyzing pressure, temperature, and velocity profiles.
